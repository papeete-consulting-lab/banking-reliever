# Banking — Implementation Repo for Reliever

This repo is the **implementation side** of Reliever, a financial-inclusion product.
It holds the roadmap, tasks, and generated source code and tests of every business
capability. The tactical **process model** is no longer authored here — it is
consumed **read-only** via `kpack process <CAP_ID>`.

All upstream knowledge (BCM YAML, GOV / URBA / FUNC / TECH-STRAT / TECH-TACT ADRs,
product / business / tech visions) is consumed **read-only** through a single CLI —
**`kpack`**, the shared knowledge-pack engine (container `ghcr.io/naive-unicorn/kpack`,
implementing `ADR-GCM-URBA-0002`). One engine serves every map; the corpus is selected
by the id prefix or `--context`, never by a binary name. `kpack` replaces the three
retired per-map CLIs `rlv-knowledge`, `tech` and `gov-pack`. The three corpora it
resolves for this repo:

- **`BNK.RLVR`** — the **`reliever-knowledge`** repo: BCM YAML, ADRs, visions, and the
  DDD process model (authored upstream by the `/process` skill), via `kpack pack <CAP_ID>`
  and `kpack process <CAP_ID>`.
- **`BNK.TECH`** — the **`banking-tech`** repo: runtime/deployment platform substrate,
  via `kpack pack <BNK.TECH.…>`.
- **`BNK.GOV`** — the **`banking-governance`** repo: organisation-wide enterprise GOV
  ADRs above any single product or platform, via `kpack pack <BNK.GOV.…>`.

Governance is thus layered across three scopes (org-wide `BNK.GOV`, Reliever-product
`BNK.RLVR`, tech-platform `BNK.TECH`) but reached through **one** engine. `kpack` ships
as the container `ghcr.io/naive-unicorn/kpack:v1.0.0` — invoke it as a bare `kpack`
(via the `bin/kpack` wrapper on `PATH`, or a `pipx`-installed console script); the
repo-root **`.kpack.yaml`** maps enterprise `BNK` → the `banking-governance` registry
that resolves every context. This repo never authors or modifies upstream artifacts.

```

The pipeline is **launched and resumed** through one entry point:

```
/implementation-pipeline
```

It probes upstream readiness via `kpack`, inspects local artifacts, and
dispatches the next pending stage. It is idempotent — re-invoke after each
stage completes to advance.

---

## What `/implementation-pipeline` actually does

When you invoke the skill it:

1. **Probes upstream readiness** for each capability:
   ```bash
   kpack pack <CAP_ID> --deep --compact > /tmp/probe.json
   jq '.slices'  /tmp/probe.json   # all required slices must be non-empty
   jq '.warnings' /tmp/probe.json  # must be empty
   ```
   Required slices: `product_vision`, `business_vision`, `tech_vision`,
   `governing_tech_strat`, `capability_definition`, `tactical_stack`,
   `capability_self`. If any is empty or `warnings` is non-empty, the
   skill stops and redirects you to the upstream repo.

2. **Inspects local artifacts** with `ls` — never touches `/bcm/`, `/func-adr/`,
   `/adr/`, `/strategic-vision/`, `/product-vision/`, `/tech-vision/`, `/tech-adr/`
   (those are upstream and not authoritative locally).

3. **Reports per-capability status** as a table of ✅ / ⏳ / ⬜ across the six
   stages, and names the next action.

4. **Dispatches the cheapest pending stage**:

   | Pending state | Action |
   |---|---|
   | Capabilities with a complete `kpack pack` slice but `kpack process <CAP_ID>` does not resolve | Tells you to run `/process <CAP_ID>` in the **reliever-knowledge** repo and merge its PR |
   | Capabilities where `kpack process <CAP_ID>` resolves but no `roadmap.md` | Spawns one `/roadmap` subagent per capability, in parallel |
   | Capabilities with a roadmap but no tasks | Spawns one `/task` subagent per capability, in parallel |
   | Tasks exist | Hands off to `/launch-task` (which calls `/sort-task` first) |

5. **Stops driving execution at Stage 3**. From there `/launch-task` is the
   scheduler and `/code` is the worker — see below.

---

## The six stages

### Stage 0 — Process (DDD tactical model) — **upstream**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | `/process` — lives in the **reliever-knowledge** repo, not here |
| **Reads** | `kpack pack <CAP_ID> --deep` (BCM + FUNC / URBA / TECH-STRAT ADRs + visions) |
| **Produces** | the process model — `aggregates`, `commands`, `policies`, `read-models`, `bus`, `api`, JSON Schemas (`CMD.*` / `RVT.*`), `README.md` — published in `reliever-knowledge` |
| **Consumed here** | read-only via `kpack process <CAP_ID>` (envelope: `.model.<stem>.{parsed,raw}`, `.schemas["X.schema.json"]`, `.meta`, `.readme`, `.corpus`) |

This is the **DDD tactical layer** that bridges Big-Picture Event Storming (the
upstream BCM/ADR corpus) and Software Design (the rest of the pipeline). It
captures aggregates with their invariants, the commands they accept, the
policies that wire consumed events to commands, the read-models that project
the domain events, and the RabbitMQ topology of every event published or
consumed — all in architecture-neutral YAML.

The DDD process model is authored by the `/process` skill in the
**reliever-knowledge** repo and consumed here **read-only** via
`kpack process <CAP_ID>` — exactly like the BCM corpus via `kpack pack`.
It does not live in this repo, so there is nothing to guard locally and nothing
to write under `process/`. When reading it, use `.model.<stem>.parsed` and fall
back to `.raw` when `parsed` is null (`commands` / `read-models` frequently
parse to null because of invalid-YAML flow mappings).

**Readiness gate** — `/roadmap`, `/task`, `/launch-task`, `/code`, and `/fix`
all refuse to run for a capability whose model does not resolve, i.e. whose
`kpack process <CAP_ID>` exits non-zero (its `/process` PR has not been
merged upstream in **reliever-knowledge** yet). Downstream stages only consume
process models that have been reviewed and merged upstream.

### Stage 1 — Roadmap

| | |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | `/roadmap` |
| **Reads** | `kpack pack <CAP_ID> --deep` + the process model via `kpack process <CAP_ID>` (`.model.*` slices, `.schemas[...]`) |
| **Writes** | `roadmap/<CAP_ID>/roadmap.md` (epics, milestones, exit conditions) |
| **Parallelism** | one subagent per capability |

Roadmaps are epic-level: they decompose a capability into business outcomes
with explicit exit conditions that a downstream task can prove. The roadmap
references the AGG / CMD / POL / PRJ / QRY identifiers from the process
model — it never re-derives them.

### Stage 2 — Task

| | |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | `/task` |
| **Reads** | `roadmap/<CAP_ID>/roadmap.md` + the process model via `kpack process <CAP_ID>` (`.model.*` slices, `.schemas[...]`) + `kpack pack <CAP_ID> --compact` |
| **Writes** | `tasks/<CAP_ID>/TASK-NNN-*.md` (flat per-capability folder) |
| **Frontmatter** | `task_id`, `capability_id`, `epic`, `status`, `priority`, `depends_on`, `task_type?`, `loop_count: 0`, `max_loops: 10` |
| **Parallelism** | one subagent per capability |

Tasks are unit-of-work-level: each carries a Definition of Done (DoD) that the
test stage will mechanically check off.

### Stage 3a — sort-task (read-only board)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | `/sort-task` |
| **Reads** | all `tasks/**/TASK-*.md` |
| **Writes** | `tasks/BOARD.md` |
| **Computes** | `ready` / `blocked` / `needs_info` / `stalled` / `in_progress` / `in_review` / `done` |
| **Auto-run** | PostToolUse hook on every TASK file change |

Pure observation. Never modifies tasks, never launches agents.

### Stage 3b — launch-task (scheduler)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | `/launch-task` |
| **Calls first** | `/sort-task` (to get fresh kanban state) |
| **Picks** | ready task by `critical_path × priority` |
| **Spawns** | one `/code` sub-agent per task |
| **Modes** | manual (suggest top 3) / reactive (on `ready` transition) / `auto` (parallel autonomous) |
| **Isolation** | each task gets its own git worktree at `/tmp/kanban-worktrees/TASK-NNN-{slug}/` on branch `feat/TASK-NNN-{slug}` |
| **Idempotency** | at most one `/code` agent per task at a time; at most one active task per capability |

### Stage 4 — Code (zone-aware)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | `/code` |
| **Reads** | task file + the process model via `kpack process <CAP_ID>` (`.model.*` slices, `.schemas[...]`) + `kpack pack <CAP_ID>` (for `zoning`) |
| **Branches on** | `task_type` (`contract-stub` → Mode B), then capability `zoning` |

| Routing | Path | Agent(s) | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task_type: contract-stub` (any zone) | C | `implement-capability` (Mode B) | `sources/<CAP_ID>/stub/` — minimal .NET worker that publishes RVT events on RabbitMQ. **Reads** the JSON Schemas via `kpack process <CAP_ID>` (`.schemas["RVT.*.schema.json"]`, does not regenerate them) |
| `BUSINESS_SERVICE_PRODUCTION` `SUPPORT` `REFERENTIAL` `EXCHANGE_B2B` `DATA_ANALYTIQUE` `STEERING` | A | `implement-capability` (Mode A) | `sources/<CAP_ID>/backend/` — .NET 10 microservice (Domain / Application / Infrastructure / Presentation / Contracts), MongoDB, RabbitMQ, `GET /health` |
| `CHANNEL` | B | `create-bff` ∥ `code-web-frontend` (parallel) | `sources/<CAP_ID>/bff/` (.NET 10 ASP.NET Core BFF) + `sources/<CAP_ID>/frontend/` (vanilla HTML5 + CSS3 + JS) |

After implementation, `/code` invokes the matching test skill (Stage 5) and
runs a remediation loop: failing tests feed back into the implementation
agent with a `── REMEDIATION CONTEXT ──` block. The loop is bounded by
`max_loops` (default 10). Exhaustion → `status: stalled`, resumable via
`/continue-work TASK-NNN [--max-loops N]`.

For non-CHANNEL Mode A, an optional **contract harness** can be attached
post-implementation via `/harness-backend <CAP_ID>` — it scaffolds a
`*.Contracts.Harness/` project that derives `openapi.yaml` and `asyncapi.yaml`
from the process model (via `kpack process <CAP_ID>` — `.model.*`, `.schemas`)
and the BCM corpus, and asserts strict alignment with bidirectional `x-lineage`
extensions.

**Branch isolation is end-to-end**: bus channels, RabbitMQ exchanges/queues,
OTel `environment` tag, frontend branch badge all carry the branch slug.
Concurrent worktrees never collide on infrastructure.

### Stage 5 — Test (zone-aware)

| | Path A — non-CHANNEL | Path B — CHANNEL |
|---|---|---|
| **Skill** | `/test-business-capability` | `/test-app` |
| **Agent** | `test-business-capability` | `test-app` |
| **Stack** | .NET service + MongoDB + RabbitMQ via docker-compose | static HTTP server (frontend) + .NET BFF + RabbitMQ |
| **Modes** | backend-only | `full-mock` / `frontend+bff` / `bff-only` |
| **Workdir** | `/tmp/test-<cap-id>-XXXXXX` (ephemeral) | `/tmp/test-app-<cap-id>-XXXXXX` (ephemeral) |
| **Generates** | `tests/<CAP_ID>/TASK-NNN-{slug}/{conftest.py, test_dod.py, test_business_rules.py, test_strategic.py, test_backend.py}` | `…/{conftest.py, test_dod.py, test_business_rules.py, test_strategic.py, test_bff.py?}` |
| **Asserts** | REST endpoints, persistence, RabbitMQ event emission, OTel tags | DOM order (dignity rule), Playwright DoD checks, BFF `/health` + ETag/304 |

Both paths produce `report.html` + `run.log`, translate pytest results into
business language (✅/❌ per DoD criterion), and tear down all spawned
processes. Original artifacts are never modified.

On success: `status: in_review`, `pr_url:` written to frontmatter, branch
pushed, `gh pr create` with DoD checklist + local-stack instructions
(including `LOCAL_PORT`, `MONGO_PORT`, `RABBIT_PORT`, `RABBIT_MGMT_PORT`,
`BFF_PORT`).

## Invariants

- **All upstream context is read-only.** GOV / URBA / TECH-STRAT / FUNC / TACTICAL
  ADRs, BCM YAML, and product/business/tech visions are consumed via `kpack`
  (context `BNK.RLVR`) only. To change them, edit the `reliever-knowledge` repo. The
  same engine serves the platform substrate (`kpack pack <BNK.TECH.…>`, `banking-tech`)
  and the organisation-wide governance ADRs (`kpack pack <BNK.GOV.…>`,
  `banking-governance`) — all equally read-only here.
- **The process model is upstream and read-only here.** It is authored by the
  `/process` skill in the **reliever-knowledge** repo and consumed here via
  `kpack process <CAP_ID>` — exactly like the BCM corpus via `kpack pack`.
  It does not live in this repo, so there is nothing to guard locally and
  nothing to write under `process/`. Its `/process` PR must be merged upstream
  before downstream stages can consume the model — `/roadmap`, `/task`,
  `/launch-task`, `/code`, and `/fix` all gate on `kpack process <CAP_ID>`
  resolving (exit 0).
- **Folder layout is strict.** The legacy `/plan/` output folder no longer
  exists. `/roadmap/` (Stage 1) and `/tasks/` (Stages 2–3) each have a single
  authoring skill. Stage 0 is upstream. No skill writes outside its lane.
- **Every task traces back** to a roadmap epic → process model (via
  `kpack process`) → BCM capability → FUNC ADR → URBA constraints. The chain
  is unbreakable.
- **Every implementation artifact** (microservice / BFF / frontend / stub) is
  reachable from a TASK-NNN, and every routing key / aggregate / command it uses
  is defined in the process model, consumed via `kpack process <CAP_ID>`.
- **Branch isolation** — one branch per task, ports & exchanges scoped by branch
  slug, parallel worktrees never collide.
- **One code agent per task** at a time; one active task per capability.
- **Loop counters live on the TASK file**, not on the board. The code skill is the
  sole writer of `loop_count`, `max_loops`, `stalled_reason`, `pr_url`.
